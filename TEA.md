# TEA: The Epigenomics analysis for Arabidopsis thaliana.

#### Abstract
#### Introduction/Background 

We proposed a platform for plant methylation analysis. Genomic DNA is treated with sodium bisulfite to convert non-methylated cytosines to uracil while methylated cytosines remain unchanged. Coupled with high-throughput platforms such as microarrays or next generation sequencing (NGS) to allow massively parallel whole genome-wise methylation analysis.

#### Implementation: Ensembl Database Prepoccess step epimolas.jar-mtable

gene is downloaded from ensembl and tair website.

#### Results: Interpretation


#### Browse: Full-text Search, Ensembl gene annotation 



#### Analysis: DMGs, mC threshold, Gene list enrichment analysis (GO, KEGG) 


#### Visulization: Venn Diagram, Heatmap, KEGG Pathway, Circos plot, BioDalliance Browser, boxplot


#### Discussion


#### Comparison table: Arabidopsis Information Resource, Ensembl Plant, Galaxy, other analysis pipeline


#### Conclusion A Resource for WGBS, RRBS annotation and analysis


#### Suppl. Methods
